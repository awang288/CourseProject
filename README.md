# Book Recommender using GoodReads data
### By: Amanda Wang, Jennifer Jasperse, and Arely Alcantara

## Overview
For our final project, we have decided to use this [Goodreads dataset](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home) to build a book recommender! We realized that recommenders exist for movies, music, food, etc. and wanted to explore more on text information systems and books offer an incredible chance for us to experiment!

We implemented 2 tasks:
- Task 1: recommending books based on user inputted phrase
- Task 2: building a content-based and collaborative-filtering recommender

## Proposal
Our initial proposal for the project is found [here](https://github.com/awang288/CourseProject/blob/main/Proposal.pdf)
