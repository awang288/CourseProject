# Book Recommender using GoodReads data
### By: Amanda Wang, Jennifer Jasperse, and Arely Alcantara

## Overview
For our final project, we have decided to use this [Goodreads dataset](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home) to build a book recommender! We realized that recommenders such as Netflix, Spotify, and UberEats exist for movies, music, food, etc. and we wanted to further explore text information systems as taught in this course. Books seem like unexplored territory so we wanted to take advantage of the available data and build a book recommendation system! There’s not really a system/app in place that allows people to search a phrase or get custom recommendations for books to read - Goodreads is more to rate books and save books to read later; not really subscription based or using other user data to suggest books to users. 

In this project, we implemented 2 tasks:
- Task 1: recommending books based on user inputted phrase
- Task 2: building a content-based and collaborative-filtering recommender
